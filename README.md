## Self-Assessment

- We think our project deserves a 17 out of 20. This assessment takes into account that we have been working as a group of two, completing a project intended for a group of three (semantic/ollir/jasmin) since cp2 (including cp2). The aspect that has impacted us the most is the ollir component, which is designed for groups of three members.
